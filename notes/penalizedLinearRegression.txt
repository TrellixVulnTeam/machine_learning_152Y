"Penalized linear regression provides a way to systematically reduce
degrees of freedom to match the amount of data available and the
complexity of the underlying problem."
-Michael Bowles, Machine Learning In Python

Excellent algorithm for problems with very many degrees of freedom, like gene sequence predictions and text classification.
Penalized linear regression models train much more quickly than ensemble methods, and are often useful early in the
development life cycle to provide insight into valuable features of the data set and a baseline comparison for other
algorithms that might be experimented with later on in the process. PLR methods also generate predictions much faster
than ensemble methods which is a significant benefit for highly time sensitive procedures (like Internet ad insertions)

Only handles numeric attributes and labels, categorical attributes and labels must be converted into numbers.
