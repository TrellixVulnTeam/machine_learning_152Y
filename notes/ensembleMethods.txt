"The basic idea with ensemble methods is to build a horde of different predictive models
and then combine their outputs - by averaging the outputs or taking the majority answer."
- Michael Bowles, Machine Learning In Python

Many machine learning problems demonstrate instability, in which the addition of new data
causes radical changes to the model or its resulting performance. Ensemble methods are
used as a tool to help reduce the variance by generating a large number of independent
models all derived from the same "base learner".
