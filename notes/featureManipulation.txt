"Feature extraction is the process of taking data from a free-form arrangement,
such as words in a document or on a web page, and arranging them into rows and
columns of numbers... Feature engineering is the process of manipulating and
combining features to arrive at more informative ones."
-Michael Bowles, Machine Learning In Python
