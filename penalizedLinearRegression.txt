"Penalized linear regression provides a way to systematically reduce
degrees of freedom to match the amount of data available and the
complexity of the underlying problem."
-Michael Bowles, Machine Learning In Python

Excellent algorithm for problems with very many degrees of freedom, like gene sequence predictions and text classification.
