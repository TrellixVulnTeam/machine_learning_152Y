### Machine learning algorithms and experiments with Python :robot:

Inspriation for the code in this repository comes from many places, including but not limited to:
1) Machine Learning in Python - Bowles
2) Machine Learning with Scikit-learn and Tensorflow - Geron
3) Deep Learning with Python - Chollet
4) Python Data Science Handbook - VanderPlas
5) Machine Learning with Python - Muller & Guido

I highly recommend all of these books.
